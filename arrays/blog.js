    content: `<h2>How Touhou Engie came to fruition</h2>
    <p>A few months ago, during my full-time job, I created this concept:</p>
    <img src="./Images/un_owen_engie.png">
    <p>Looking back, it wasn't the most creative, nor the most innovative concept.</p>
    <p>It was a funny idea that I put on digital paper, after all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the meantime, my online presence was fragmented, with references from many different years and to many different fandoms and OCs.</p>
    <p>As part of unifying my online presence, I went back to the drawing board and used the Engineer I created as a baseline.</p>
    <p>An hour in Goodnotes later, I come up with this:</p>
    <img src="./Images/touhou_engie_v1.png">
    <p>Needless to say, I found this worthy of replacing my old online presence with.</p>
    <p>I also tested my first artstyle, the Paperization suite (based upon Paper Mario), using this new OC.</p>
    <p>The Paperizations have been one of the most well-known and the longest-running artstyles I have utilized, and it all started from here:</p>
    <img src="./Images/paper_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">The watermark here really shows how I desparately needed a rebrand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, it was a strong start at revitalizing what I used to overlook for the past few years, especially during the COVID pandemic.</p>
    <p>It also gave me a niche of art that I realized that I enjoyed making every once in a while.</p>
    <p>Before I sign off, here are two variants that I received from friends on Discord:</p>
    <img src="./Images/bubblee_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">I still cherish this one. Made by @onepiecesimp</p>
    <img src="./Images/exotech_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">Fun fact: this was made entirely in Microsoft Word. Made by @exotechs</p>
    <p>P.S. If you want to use these variants, feel free. But PLEASE attribute the person who made them alongside me. They deserve more credit.</p>

    date: "11/2/25",
    content: `<p>Got quite busy there lately, so i'm just going to do a lightning round of stuff.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First, here's some Halloween art. It's still Dia de los Muertos today so a possessed Hatsune Miku still fits.</p>
    <img src="./Images/mesmerizer_miku.png">
    <p>Second, here's a pic of Daybright Coffee, which is the result of Chick-fil-A attempting to compete with Starbucks.</p>
    <img src="./Images/daybright.png">
    <p>Fun fact: I rarely consume caffeine outside of the occasional Coca-Cola, especially since not even adding milk, sugar, or cream to coffee makes it any more bearable to drink.</p>
    <p>This was also when I realized that cappuchinos were not supposed to be sweet out of the box, and that Racetrac had fooled my family for years.</p>
    <p>Well, at least the hot vanilla latte gave me an enjoyable drink that gave me the energy to pull through my evening shift that day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let's move to a roadmap of what I have planned for this site.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm working on the bulletin board, which will allow for you readers to send public inquiries to me.</p>
    <p>Don't worry, I still have plans to finish the Gallery. More details to come about that.</p>
    <p>However, the next two weeks are going to be a doozy with plans ranging from extracurriculars to group projects.</p>
    <p>Other features planned for this website include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A web browser within a web browser. It's a dumb idea and I love it.</li>
      <li>An earlier alpha version (before the reset) had a terminal mockup, which I planned (and still plan) to write in and learn React with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's all for now. See you all in two weeks when I have the time to write another blogpost.</p>
