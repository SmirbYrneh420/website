    content: `<h2>How Touhou Engie came to fruition</h2>
    <p>A few months ago, during my full-time job, I created this concept:</p>
    <img src="./Images/un_owen_engie.png">
    <p>Looking back, it wasn't the most creative, nor the most innovative concept.</p>
    <p>It was a funny idea that I put on digital paper, after all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the meantime, my online presence was fragmented, with references from many different years and to many different fandoms and OCs.</p>
    <p>As part of unifying my online presence, I went back to the drawing board and used the Engineer I created as a baseline.</p>
    <p>An hour in Goodnotes later, I come up with this:</p>
    <img src="./Images/touhou_engie_v1.png">
    <p>Needless to say, I found this worthy of replacing my old online presence with.</p>
    <p>I also tested my first artstyle, the Paperization suite (based upon Paper Mario), using this new OC.</p>
    <p>The Paperizations have been one of the most well-known and the longest-running artstyles I have utilized, and it all started from here:</p>
    <img src="./Images/paper_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">The watermark here really shows how I desparately needed a rebrand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, it was a strong start at revitalizing what I used to overlook for the past few years, especially during the COVID pandemic.</p>
    <p>It also gave me a niche of art that I realized that I enjoyed making every once in a while.</p>
    <p>Before I sign off, here are two variants that I received from friends on Discord:</p>
    <img src="./Images/bubblee_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">I still cherish this one. Made by @onepiecesimp</p>
    <img src="./Images/exotech_touhou_engie.png">
    <p class="font-light text-xs">Fun fact: this was made entirely in Microsoft Word. Made by @exotechs</p>
    <p>P.S. If you want to use these variants, feel free. But PLEASE attribute the person who made them alongside me. They deserve more credit.</p>
