    <p>Hi. I code, draw, and drum in my spare time. When I don't have spare time it's usually due to work or school.</p>
    <p>I also run my school's one and only coding club, powered by and partnered with Hack Club (shoutout to their great programs btw)</p>
    <p>For now, here's a rendition of my OC, drawn by a friend.</p>
