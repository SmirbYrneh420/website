This is where my website lives, breathes, and thrives. It's not the most technically impressive, but it is something I like adding features to and challenging myself to write for.

Features:
- Draggable windows
- Preemptive multitasking...mostly
- A music player (not my music though, credits to the original composers provided)
- A half-functional Godot tech demo that I coded for a game jam :p
- Custom cursors (not my cursors either, credit goes to SEGA [Miku cursor] and wobb [Kagamine Rin cursor])
- An 88x31 button for your linking needs

Roadmap:
- A file viewer for my self-made, AI-free, TerminalMontage annd Paper Mario-inspired art
- An internet browser within an internet browser
- A proper form of contact
- And more!
